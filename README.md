## I revisited React Native via Expo and took the chance to learn Tailwind CSS. Creating UI components with Tailwind was an exciting learning curve.

<li>Carousel of Images for Categories: Introducing a visually captivating carousel that showcases images for various categories.</li>

<li>Dynamic Like Button: Adding a touch of interactivity, the Like button now responds dynamically. Utilizing the power of useState, the button elegantly switches to red when pressed, providing instant user feedback.</li>

<li>Navigation Paths with useNavigation: Seamlessly connecting pages with useNavigation. Navigating between different sections of the app is made intuitive, enhancing user experience and flow.</li>
